# Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Explorer

![Project Image](path/to/your/image.png)  <!-- Replace with the actual image path -->

## Description

The Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Explorer is an interactive tool designed to visualize and compare the performance of different pathfinding algorithms. It offers an intuitive way for users to understand the efficiency and behavior of various algorithms, making it a valuable resource for students and developers alike.

### Features
- **Adjustable Grid Size:** Users can customize the size of the grid to see how different dimensions affect algorithm performance.
- **Real-time Path Calculation:** As users place obstacles and initiate pathfinding, the algorithms compute paths in real-time.
- **Obstacle Placement:** Users can add and remove obstacles on the grid, allowing them to test how algorithms navigate around them.
- **Step-by-Step Exploration:** Users can step through the algorithm's process to observe how it finds a path from start to finish.

## Algorithms
- A*
- Dijkstra
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Bidirectional Search
